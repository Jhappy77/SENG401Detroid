-	Improve the evaluation, especially the handling of pinned pieces and checks or double checks.
-	Study what other terms other engines have. Define less essential terms for the extended evaluation part to further refine the final score
-	Implement a generic LRU Cache util to use for the EGBT entries and incorporate look ups into the search.
-	Create an EGTB interface for end game tablebases/bitbases with all the necessary methods for probing and whatsoever.
-	Create a class GaviotaEGTB that implements EGTB. It should use Ballicora's native probing library. A good example of such an implementation can
	be found here: http://www.programcreek.com/java-api-examples/index.php?source_dir=chessonline-master/src/com/if3games/chessonline/gtb/Probe.java
-	Set up a parameter tuning framework possibly using cutechess-cli and genetic algorithms such as PBIL. (v 0.9)
-	Add support for multi-PV. (v 0.95)
-	Implement SMP. (v 1.0)
